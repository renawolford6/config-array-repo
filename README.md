## Description

A config array is a way of managing configurations that are based on glob pattern matching of filenames. Each config array contains the information needed to determine the correct configuration for any file based on the filename. 

## Background

In 2019, I submitted an [ESLint RFC]() proposing a new way of configuring ESLint. The goal was to streamline what had become an increasingly complicated configuration process.


## Installation

You can install config-array using npm or Yarn:

```bash
npm install @humanwhocodes/config-array --save

# or

yarn add @humanwhocodes/config-array
```

## Usage
